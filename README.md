# JavaScript Exercises

Welcome to my JavaScript Exercises repository! As a beginner web developer I've completed the exercises as part of my learning process to become more comfortable with JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a record of my progress in mastering JavaScript fundamentals and working with the Document Object Model (DOM). The exercises included here cover a variety of topics, ranging from basic concepts like objects and events to more advanced DOM manipulation techniques.
The repository is organized with a folder for each exercise. Inside each exercise folder you`ll find an HTML file and a JS file where I've completed the task.
